# **Clutch: Multi-Identity Service for Enterprise Security and Observability**

**Clutch** is a Spring Boot-based enterprise-grade application that integrates multiple identity providers (e.g., SAML, Keycloak, Azure IAM, AWS IAM, Okta) to provide robust authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and observability. It is designed for scalability, performance, and security.

## **Features**
- **Multi-Identity Provider Support**:
    - Seamlessly switch between SAML, Keycloak, Azure IAM, AWS IAM, and Okta.
    - Configurable via `application.yml` or environment variables.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - Enforce security with roles like `ADMIN`, `DEV`, `AUDIT`, and `OPERATIONS`.

- **JWT-Based API Security**:
    - Secure APIs with issued JWT tokens containing user roles and claims.

- **Observability**:
    - Integrated with **Micrometer** and **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
    - Dashboards with **Grafana** for monitoring authentication and API performance.
